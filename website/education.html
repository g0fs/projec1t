                    <h2>What is Blockchain?</h2>
                    <p>Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that underlies cryptocurrencies. It allows for secure,
                        transparent, and tamper-proof recording of transactions.</p>
                    <p>At its core, a blockchain is a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. When a
                        transaction occurs, it is added to a block. Each block is linked to the previous one through a
                        cryptographic hash, forming a continuous chain. This structure ensures the integrity and security of the
                        data.</p>
                    <p>Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain has numerous applications, including supply chain management,
                        voting systems, and digital identity verification. Its decentralized nature eliminates the need for
                        intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.</p>

                    <h2>How Cryptocurrency Works</h2>
                    <p>Cryptocurrencies use public and private keys to secure transactions. When you send cryptocurrency, it is
                        recorded on the blockchain and verified by network nodes through cryptography. Each transaction is then
                        added to a block and linked to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks (blockchain).</p>
                    <p>Users store their public and private keys in a digital wallet. The public key acts as an address that
                        others can use to send cryptocurrency to the user, while the private key is used to sign transactions
                        and access the funds.</p>
                    <p>Transactions are verified through a consensus mechanism, such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake
                        (PoS). PoW requires miners to solve complex mathematical problems, while PoS involves validators
                        holding a stake in the cryptocurrency.</p>

                    <h2>Mining and Staking</h2>
                    <p>Mining and staking are two methods of participating in the operation of blockchain networks:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group">
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Mining:</strong> Involves validating transactions and adding them to
                            the blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, and in return,
                            they receive newly minted cryptocurrency as a reward.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Staking:</strong> Involves holding funds in a cryptocurrency wallet
                            to support the operations of a blockchain network. Stakers are selected to validate transactions and
                            receive rewards based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and "stake" in the network.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Proof of Work (PoW):</strong> A consensus mechanism where miners
                            compete to solve cryptographic puzzles. Bitcoin and Ethereum (before Ethereum 2.0) use PoW.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Proof of Stake (PoS):</strong> A consensus mechanism that selects
                            validators based on the number of coins they hold and are willing to "stake" as collateral. Ethereum
                            2.0 and Cardano use PoS.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS):</strong> A variation of PoS where
                            stakeholders vote for delegates to validate transactions on their behalf. EOS and TRON use DPoS.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Mining typically requires significant investment in hardware and electricity, whereas staking can be
                        done with less upfront cost but requires holding a certain amount of cryptocurrency.</p>
